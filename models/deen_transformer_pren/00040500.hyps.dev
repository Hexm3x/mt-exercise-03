return on the very American Ideal of working rights as human rights
Keith Ellison and John Lewis have submitted a legislative proposal to establish a legislation in order to establish the organisation of trade unions .
`` such as trade unions , &apos;&apos; `` Caucus , &apos;&apos; said Ellison , said Ellison , said Ellison , a Democrats from Minnesota and manufacturing of the Progressive Caucus in Congress .
that is why I am proud jointly with the Ombudsman John Lewis the employee powerful .
employees the same legal opportunities , employees the same legal possibilities in discrimination because of the organisation of trade unions such as in other forms of discrimination - and stopped .
the supplement of the national labour law , in order to create a way for discrimination of the workers to organisation of a discrimination in order to cause justice - and in order to cause justice .
but it is not a radical initiative - at least not after American standards .
indeed , the best way is the best way of what Ellison , Lewis , and the further sponsors of their laws , and the other sponsors of their laws , the link to a very American idea .
despite the reflects which have been exposed - in Wisconsin , Michigan and other states in the whole country - of Americans , and other countries in all the world - have been encouraged in all over the world .
it has been a time to the millions of Americans , freedom , freedom , freedom , freedom , freedom , freedom , freedom , freedom , freedom and freedom .
as the United States after the Second World War Japan &apos;s Douglas Mac Arthur and his state the country to adopt the constitution of a constitution that the militarized authoroccupation of the Sci Tojos by democracy .
in full knowledge that the workers and their societies in the creation of a new Japan is a part of the creation of a new Japan , the explicitly recognized that ` the rights of the workers of the workers in the United States .
as the United States after the Second World War II Germany , David David Eisenhower and his state of the German , a constitution that would ensure that the Faschism Adolf Hitlers would be replaced by a strong democracy .
in recognition of the fact that the workers have to organize , and their voice in the new nation of the new nation , the Deutsche Klausel is a expliciting : `` the right to founds &apos; right to safeguard labour and economic conditions .
agreements of this right or restricting this right or restrictions , nonetheless , nonetheless measures .
as the former of Lady Eleanor Roosevelt the Presidency on the International Human Rights Commission &apos; s Humanor Roosevelt of human rights claims , such as in 1948 by the United Nations .
since the General Americans accept that working rights are human rights .
in other countries , such as civilian and democratic societies could be able to take part in the Americans that the right to the foundation of a peace - and that these trade will then be held to take part as equal partners with companies and governance .
after these rights in America &apos;s rights , it is actually very much to the American ideal ideal to the American ideal idea to return to the work of the people who have the right to remove into a freedom and open society .
as Pastor Martin Luther King Jr.
the history is a great deal .
now everyone knows that the workers do not restricted , but they are enhanced .
through the recovery of the living standards of millions of people have created a market for industries and the entire nation to the entire nation of independent production .
those who are the work to take the work of the work , these simple perception , but the history .
the history is that and we should do .
the formal recognition of work as human rights - and enlargement of the protection of citizens &apos; rights than protection against discrimination in the creation of workers .
